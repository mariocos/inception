Hello, This is my "inception" project.

Its a simple Docker exercise using nginx, wordpress and mariadb.

My objective is to create a Makefile that configures a basic file structure and run docker-compose
with a yaml file wich will launch the respective services.

/*-------------------*/
       nginx
/*-------------------*/

Nginx like any other service requires its own dockerfile, and a .conf file to setup.

html files is good practice to be in /etc/www/.
nginx .conf is good practice to be in /etc/nginx/.

docker file part:

nginx comands:
"sudo nginx -t" tests the syntax of a .conf file 

add .conf file to the right place 

sudo cp nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf


docker compose 

-f specifies file path for the yaml

-d to detach and run in background 

--build will make it generate images for the services.

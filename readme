Hello, This is my "inception" project.

Its a simple Docker exercise using nginx, wordpress and mariadb.

My objective is to create a Makefile that configures a basic file structure and run docker-compose
with a yaml file wich will launch the respective services.

/*-------------------*/
       nginx
/*-------------------*/

Nginx like any other service requires its own dockerfile, and a .conf file to setup.

html files is good practice to be in /etc/www/.
nginx .conf is good practice to be in /etc/nginx/.



docker file part:

nginx comands:
"sudo nginx -t" tests the syntax of a .conf file 

add .conf file to the right place 

sudo cp nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

how to restart nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
if the .conf file is already in the suposed folder it should already be up
if you want to specify the .conf file you have to do so with the comand:
sudo nginx -c [path to file]
and reload
sudo systemctl reload nginx

docker compose 

-f specifies file path for the yaml

-d to detach and run in background 

--build will make it generate images for the services.

/* docker  */

make sure you are in the docker group
